Hi, I'm Raphael - a senior software engineer, passionate about learning new technologies.

I've been working with software development since 2007, but have always been curious about how wonderful is to be able to help improve people lifes whit some lines of code.

As a fun fact, I have a background as a graphics designer, which leads me to enjoy a lot more to work with frontend than backend. Don't take me wrong, I know how important is to be able to develop the backend of the application and I do know how to do it. But, have you ever felt the satisfaction of opening for the first time a beautiful, full responsive application frontend in production? It's a really enjoyable thing to do!
